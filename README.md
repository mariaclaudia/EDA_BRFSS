Exploratory Data Analysis on Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and Sleep disorders

## Whats is BRFSS: 

[**BRFSS**](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html) ia a large phone anonymous survey conduceted **every year** through a state and federal collaboration and with **NHANES** represents the main US risk factor Surveillance. 

BRFSS is conducted by the **CDC** (Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention, the U.S federal agency) and it's composed by "Core" questions and "modules". The "core" datasets are public and used by both governmental and independent researches.

The objective of the BRFSS is to collect uniform, state-specific data on preventive health practices and risk behaviors that are linked to chronic diseases, injuries, and preventable infectious diseases in the adult population. Factors assessed by the BRFSS include tobacco use, health care coverage, HIV/AIDS knowledge or prevention, physical activity, and fruit and vegetable consumption. Data are collected from a random sample of adults (one per household) through a telephone survey.

In healthcare, there may only be limited scientific evidence to support a KPI and it becomes
necessary to avail of expert opinion.

## Sleep Disorders

Adults need 7 or more hours of sleep per night for the best health and wellbeing.1 Short sleep duration is defined as less than 7 hours of sleep per 24-hour period.

Sleep-related difficulties affect many people. Notably, insufficient sleep has been linked to the development 
and management of a number of chronic diseases and conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, 
and depression.

- **Obesity**

Laboratory research has found that short sleep duration results in metabolic changes that may be linked to obesity. 
Epidemiologic studies conducted in the community have also revealed an association between short sleep duration and excess body weight. This association has been reported in all age groups—but has been particularly pronounced in children. 

- **Depression**

The relationship between sleep and depression is complex. While sleep disturbance has long been held to be an important symptom of depression, recent research has indicated that depressive symptoms may decrease once sleep apnea has been effectively treated and sufficient sleep restored. The interrelatedness of sleep and depression suggests it is important that the sleep sufficiency of persons with depression be assessed and that symptoms of depression be monitored among persons with a sleep disorder. 4, 5
